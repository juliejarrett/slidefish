A sample Passport + Express application which demonstrates how to successfully use
[passport-stormpath](https://github.com/stormpath/passport-stormpath) to handle
user authentication and authorization for your web app.


## Getting Started

To get started, you'll want to first clone this GitHub repository locally:

```

Next, you'll want to go into the sample app directory:
