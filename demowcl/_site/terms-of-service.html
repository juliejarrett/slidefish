<h3><span style="color: #008000;">Wash Cycle Laundry Inc.</span><br />
Wash-and-Fold Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>Rest assured, your satisfaction is our first priority. In fact, we treat your laundry as if it were our own, however we still need to agree to some rules to ensure that there are no misunderstandings about Wash Cycle Laundry Inc.’s (referred to as “we,” “us,” “our”, or “Wash Cycle Laundry”) or your obligations. By using our service, you acknowledge and accept the following Terms and Conditions.</p>
<h4>Suitability for Laundering</h4>
<p>By using our service, you agree that your clothes are suitable to be washed in water, on a normal cycle, and dried using heat in a tumble dryer. We cannot be responsible for any damage to clothing that is not suitable for this standard laundering process.</p>
<h4>Damaged Laundry</h4>
<p>We will do everything we can to avoid damaging your laundry. Unfortunately there are limitations to what we can do. For example, we don’t have time to check your pockets to see if you have left anything in them. Therefore, we can’t be held responsible if something left in your laundry (like lipstick or chewing gum) causes any damage. Similarly, if you call and tell us that you left your favorite bracelet, or anything else, in your pocket, we can’t guarantee that we will find or return it.</p>
<p>All laundering processes, regardless of how gentle, cause normal wear and tear on clothing. As a result, we cannot be responsible for any wear and tear of laundry, including loss of buttons, fading, fatiguing, holes, or abrasions. Similarly, we reserve the right to decline cleaning any particular piece of laundry if we think it will lead to trouble.</p>
<p>Cleaning and drying laundry also creates other risks. We do not individually examine every garment prior to placing it in the laundry. Therefore, if something is “dry-clean only,” or otherwise unsuitable for common washing and drying techniques, please do not include it in the laundry you give to us. Along the same lines, we can’t be held responsible for the re-disposition of colors (aka bleeding) or dimensional changes (aka shrinking or stretching).</p>
<h4>Lost Laundry</h4>
<p>We would love to be able to inventory every piece of laundry you give us. Unfortunately, it is cost-prohibitive for us to do so. As a result we can’t be held responsible for any lost laundry; we simply have no efficient way of verifying that we actually received any particular piece of laundry in the first place.</p>
<p>Rest assured though, we carefully track your clothes. For instance, we tag all our bundles with your name, and your clothes are never loose in our facility unless they&#8217;re inside a machine, on the folding table, or in their own laundry cart waiting to be folded. We only fold one person&#8217;s garments at a time. And we make sure that there aren&#8217;t any lost stragglers at each step of the process, and are really good about reuniting lost socks with the right shirts and pants.</p>
<p>If you do believe you are missing something from your delivery, please notify us within 24 hours of receiving your clean clothes &#8212; we are much more likely to find misplaced laundry if it is reported early.</p>
<h4>Scheduling and Payment</h4>
<p>If you no longer want our service, simply let us know and we will cancel it. Although we truly hope you are satisfied with our services, once we have laundered your clothes, we cannot offer a refund.<br />
To make life simpler, we round to the nearest pound when weighing your laundry to determine if you have exceeded your allotted weight limit. If you have exceeded your weight limit we will promptly notify you of any surcharge. Of course we don’t anticipate having any problems with customers refusing to pay an appropriate surcharge, but just in case, we reserve the right to hold your laundry hostage until we are paid in full.</p>
<h4>Minimum Fee</h4>
<p>If you schedule us to come to pick-up your laundry, we have a minimum charge per pick-up of $5.00, regardless of whether or not you give us laundry to wash. Remember, you’re free to cancel any appointment at any time, so if you don’t have any laundry for us to wash on a particular week, please be sure to notify us before your appointment time so we don’t come to your address or charge you this fee.</p>
<h4>Pick-up and Delivery Scheduling</h4>
<p>Wash Cycle Laundry provides pick-up and delivery service on bicycles, saving a lot of gas, pollution, and money. We are particularly proud of this aspect of our business and hope that our bicycle pick-up and delivery service is part of the reason you have decided to use Wash Cycle. There are, however, circumstances when we may be unable to use bicycles to complete deliveries (like snow, torrential rain, or all of our delivery riders simultaneously pulling a hamstring). Therefore, we reserve the right to pick-up and deliver your laundry using more conventional methods.</p>
<p>We will do our best to pick-up your laundry at the agreed upon time. We know that we won’t have very many customers if we are late. That being said, we can’t be held accountable if we are late for unforeseen circumstances. Similarly, we hope that you will strive to be on-time for our deliveries. If you do miss a pick-up or delivery, we will try to coordinate an alternate time as soon as possible.</p>
<h4>Unattended Pick-up and Delivery</h4>
<p><strong>Finally, if you request that we leave your laundry unattended (e.g., on your porch, in a hallway, or in your foyer) or with a third party (e.g., with a doorman or a neighbor) when we deliver it, we are not responsible for your laundry before we have picked it up or after we have dropped it off.</strong> You also agree that our records of pick-up and drop-off times are true and accurate.</p>
<h4>Allergies</h4>
<p>We use Sun and Earth Brand laundry detergents for all our personal laundry customers. Sun and Earth markets this detergent as “hypoallergenic.” However, we do wash clothes in shared washing machines where other detergents may have been used, and it is possible that small amounts of other detergents, which may not be hypoallergenic, may not be completely rinsed out of these washing machines.</p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>As our business changes, we may want to modify some of terms in this agreement. Therefore, we encourage you to check back frequently to familiarize yourself with any changes.</p>
<p>Although we think we are generally agreeable people, we recognize that Wash Cycle Laundry and you may have a dispute. In this event, you agree that any legal action pertaining to this agreement, or Wash Cycle Laundry generally, shall be conducted in the Courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>

                            Wash Cycle Laundry is a social enterprise with three missions. First, we are proving that bikes are cheaper, greener, commercially scalable alternatives to trucks for urban delivery. Second, we are demonstrating that service economy jobs can be paths to upward mobility, even for vulnerable adults. And, of course, we're trying to make a bit of money while we're at it.
