                            Wash Cycle Laundry is a social enterprise with three missions. First, we are proving that bikes are cheaper, greener, commercially scalable alternatives to trucks for urban delivery. Second, we are demonstrating that service economy jobs can be paths to upward mobility, even for vulnerable adults. And, of course, we're trying to make a bit of money while we're at it.
