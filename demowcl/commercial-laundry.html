					We know that laundry's the last thing you want to think about. We also know your business can't run without it. No matter your size, Wash Cycle Laundry can do your dirty work.

	        				Start asking your front desk staff to sell to your customers instead of asking them to do your laundry. Hiring us to provide towel service will pay for itself the first time your receptionist sells that extra treatment or personal training session instead of running back and forth to load the dryer.

	        			<p>
	        				With three laundry facilities in Philadelphia, we can handle any size job. In the past, we've handled loads from 20 lbs of laundry to 2,000 lbs of laundry in a single day. Our bikes can each haul 400 lbs at a time, and we'll send our whole fleet to your store if you need us to!

	        			<p>
	        				We grew up washing clothes for consumers, so customer service is in our DNA. Our phone line is staffed until 8:30pm every night, and you won't find a friendlier (or better looking) delivery crew on this side of the Mississippi River.
