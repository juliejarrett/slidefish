		<h2>Thanks for Signing Up!</h2>
		<p>
			You'll love our service. Our delivery managers are now busy placing you on a route; there's nothing more you have to do, but you'll get another confirmation email from us once you are "activated" in our system. Now, all you have to do is think of how you'll spend all your extra time. And give yourself a pat on the back for making a decision that will save gallons of water and gas whenever you use us.
		</p>
		<h3>A few housekeeping notes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Have your laundry ready for us in whatever container suits you; people sometimes use plastic bags, pillow cases, laundry hampers, and those reusable canvas bags you get everywhere -- whatever works! We'll give it back to you in one of our snazzy bags, along with your original container.</li>
			<li>If you have any questions or would like to schedule your next service, please feel free to email support@washcyclelaundry.com, give us a call at 1-888-611-WASH (9274) from 8am - 9pm, M-F.</li>
			<li>You can alsoÂ log-on to our self-service portal, at https://secure.washcyclelaundry.com. Your temporary password should be included in your registration email.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Thanks again!</p>
