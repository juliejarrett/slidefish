                <h5>When do you pick up and deliver?</h5>
                <p>
                    For our wash and fold service, you choose which weekdays work best for you. We have two available time windows for pickups and drop-offs: 4-6pm and 6-8pm.

                <p>
                	For our commercial laundry service, we operate on weekdays during normal business hours, and we work to accommodate your schedule.  Give us a call at 1-888-611-9274, use our live chat support in the bottom corner of the page, or email us at help@washcyclelaundry.com.

        		<h5>What areas do you service? Do you ever travel outside of your stated service area?</h5>
        		<p>
        			Right now, we service all of Center City, and big swaths of West, South, and North Philadelphia. We unfortunately can't quite make it out to Mt. Airy. Manyunk, or the Great Northeast. You can find an exact map of our delivery area on our <a href="index.html#where-we-pedal">homepage</a>

        			We can usually accommodate same-day service requests. Give us a call right away so we can see if there's room for you on the roster! We charge a $20 rush fee for most same-day orders.

        		<h5>Do you operate on weekends or holidays?</h5>
        		<p>
        			We don't operate on weekends or the following holidays: New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day/4th of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day. We often also suspend operations the evening before these holidays -- so we won't be picking up laundry at  6pm on December 24th, though we'll be pedaling away during the daytime.

        		<h5>How much laundry can you fit on your trailers?</h5>
        		<p>
        			We're so happy you asked! It depends if the laundry's wet or not. We don't like to load the trailers with much more than 300 lbs of laundry (that's 30 loads of your home washer), though legend has it that Jake and James once hauled 500 lbs of sopping wet gym towels a few miles through Center City.

        		<h5>Do I need to sort my laundry before you pick it up?</h5>
        		<p>
        			For our wash and fold service you do NOT need to pre-sort your laundry. Just make sure it is in a soft container of some kind, and we'll return it with one of our green laundry bags for you to use next time around.
